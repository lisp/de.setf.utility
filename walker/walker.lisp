 (description
  "The walker operates on both acyclic and cyclic directed graphs, and performs either preorder,
  endorder, or symmetric order traversal. The behaviour is factored into distinct classes for node and
  link traversal and manipulation each of which contributes qualifiers to an effective method. The potential
  method complement is determined by the node class, but the actions of the effective methos are further
  constrained based on the actual argument. (see the denominated method combination.)
  an application controls the behaviour by providing a walker which mixes in the desired control classes
  to offer the desired methods and, if needed, specializes the :qualifying method to indicate which aspects
  of the effective method to run.
  
  The traversal terminology follows from Knuth (section 2.3 of "fundamental algorithms"), as does the test
  example. His discussion concentrates on the graph nodes and relegates the links to representational artifacts,
  so the terms "initial" and "final" node are adopted from Truss ("discrete methematics for computer scientists").
  
  A test example demonstrates how the abstract components are combined to define a walker.
  The literal test model does not agree with Knuth's list notation (p 334 of the 1968 edition), as this latter 
  is ambiguous and incomplete, but that does not affect the results."))


(:documentation "class structure"

  "the abstract walker classes distinguish the aspects

 - walker is the abstract class for which the elementary interface functions - walk-model
   walk-node, and walk-link, are defined.
 - walk-operator distinguishes classes intended to operate on nodes and links.
 - walk-navigator distinguishes classes intended to traverse nodes and links.
 - cyclic-walker binds a cache and implements operations to record properties for nodes and links.
   uses recorded node properties to limit node operations to once only.
 - acyclic-walker distinguishes classes intended to traverse nodes and links.


these abstract classes are specialized to distinguish walking patterns

 - node-operator operates on nodes
 - node-constituent-navigator traverses a node's constituents
 - node-predecessor-navigator traverses a node's predecessors
 - node-successor-navigator traverses a node's successors
 - link-navigator traverse from a links origin to its target
 - link-relation-operator operates on a named link relation


these, in turn, are combined in classes which implement concrete walking patterns

 - node-walker
 - preorder-node-walker operates on the node and constituents, then walks predecessors, then successors
 - symmetric-node-walker traverses predecessors, then the node and constituents, then traverses the successors
 - endorder-node-walker walks predecessors, then successors, then operates on the node and constituents
 - node-navigator  walks predecessors, then successors, but does not operate on a node 
 - preorder-link-walker operates on a links relation then traverses from origin to target
 - endorder-link-walker traversed from origin to target, then operates on a links relation

  "The traversal operators implement symmetric iteration over nodes and links involving
 the distinct phases

 - operate on the node
 - navigate from the node through the links
 - operate on the link
 - navigate from the link through the nodes

 The implementation is expressed in distinct qualified methods for the functions walk-node and walk-link.
 Each method is qualifed to indicate its role in a general traversal

 - from nodes: self, predecessors, and successors
 - from links: other, and relations.

 In both cases, the order of combination is determined for the respective navigator class through the method
 combination, in that it integrates the denominated methods as specialized by the walker through the various
 forms of walker-*-qualifiers. Each of the abstract classes node-operator, node-predecessor-navigator,
 node-successor-navigator, link-relation-operator, and link-navigator contribute a qualifier and the
